##### **Project Description** #####
This project shows how to load a partial view containing a Grid inside a TabStrip. When Telerik UI components are loaded via ajax their JavaScript files must be manually registered with the ScriptRegistrar. In this project the JavaScript files needed by the Grid are registered in the master page: ~/Views/Shared/Site.master.

##### **Important!** #####
Since the Q2 2011 release of Telerik Extensions for ASP.NET MVC, manual JavaScript registration is no longer required.
