##### **Project Description** #####
The attached project demonstrates two techniques for making the TabStrip tabs overlap, similarly to the ones of TabStrip for ASP.NET AJAX. The first approach is easier to implement, but does not work in IE8 and older browsers, which do not support CSS rounded corners. The second approach works across all contemporary browsers, but requires you to prepare background images for the tabs, which match to the appearance of the used skin.
