#Telerik Extensions for ASP.NET MVC CodeLibrary (discontinued)

In this repository you can find the Telerik Extensions for ASP.NET MVC Code Libraries. Please note however that **as of June 2013, Telerik Extensions for ASP.NET MVC has reached its official End of Life (EOL)**, with no additional fixes or enhancements expected in the future. It's highly recommended to **[upgrade to Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/getting-started/using-kendo-with/aspnet-mvc/migration/migrating-from-telerik-extensions-for-aspnet-mvc)** ([Product page](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc)) as we no longer provide support for the Telerik Extensions.
